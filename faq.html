						<p><b>#1. What is e-waste?</b><br>
						- Electronic waste or e-waste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices. Used electronics<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which are destined for reuse, resale, salvage, recycling or disposal are also considered e-waste.</p>
						<br>
						<p><b>#2. Why its disposal is necessary?</b><br>
						- Informal processing of e-waste in developing countries can lead to adverse human health effects<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and environmental pollution.</p>
						<br>
						<p><b>#3. Where to dispose off our e-waste?</b><br>
						- Since electronic waste is subject to India’s hazardous waste regulations, it must be reused,<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recycled, or disposed of properly. Please do not put these items in the garbage or curbside<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recycling bins.</p>
						<br>
						<p><b>#4. What is the environmental impact of e-waste?</b><br>
						- Liquid and atmospheric releases end up in bodies of water, groundwater, soil, and air and therefore<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in land and sea animals &nbsp;– &nbsp;both domesticated and wild, in crops eaten by both animals and human,<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in drinking water.</p>
						<br>
						<p><b>#5. How is it harmful to human health?</b><br>
						- Electronic products are a complex mixture of several hundred tiny components, many of which<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contain deadly chemicals. These chemicals are a strain on human health and the environment.<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the components in electronic devices contain lead, cadmium, mercury, PVCs, brominated<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flame retardants (BFRs), chromium, beryllium etc., Televisions, video and computer monitors use<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cathode ray tubes (CRTs), which have significant amounts of lead.</p>
						<br>
						<p><b>#6. What gets recycled from scrapped electronics?</b><br>
						- If managed correctly, the materials that make up old electronics can be recycled safely and securely<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and converted into new base commodities that can be put back into productive use in a new device<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or product. Common materials include base ferrous metals (steel), non ferrous metals such as<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aluminum, lead and copper, precious metals such as gold, silver and palladium, many families of plastics,<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glass, and rubber. Hazardous materials can also be safely recovered and recycled including such items<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as mercury or lead, heavy metals such as lithium and cadmium found in batteries, ink/toner and even<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ethylene glycol as a coolant.</p>
						<br>
						<p><b>#7. What’s the difference between recycling and reuse?</b><br>
						- Recycling refers to the recovery of the materials used in the manufacture of electronic devices (e.g., gold,<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mercury, copper, aluminum, plastic and glass), which can then be used in the manufacture of new devices,<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reducing the consumption of non-renewable resources. Responsible recycling also ensures that these<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;materials, some of which are extremely toxic, do not find their way into landfills to cause harm to people<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the environment.
						<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reuse refers to the practice of removing working parts from retired electronic devices for resale or for<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use as replacement parts to refurbish defective devices. Those parts may include disc drives, memory<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chips and other components that can retain data and requires complete data wiping using a Department<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Defence grade data sanitization software.
