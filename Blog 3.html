                      he mammoth generation of e-waste has created a new e-waste stream in the country containing obsolete,
                      End of life Electrical and Electronics Equipments discarded after their intended use. The innovation, dynamism in product
                      design and globalization replacing these equipments in very duration and made it fast growing waste in the world. E-waste
                      is being generated by both indigenous and outsourced electrical and electronics equipments besides Basel Convention. The
                      knowhow and compatible infrastructure for e-waste treatment is limited in India and informal recycling survived under the
                      ambit of flexible legislative framework.
                    </p>
                    <h3> Matter of concern </h3>
                    <p> Industry body Assocham, on Friday, said India’s ‘production’ of e-waste is likely to increase by nearly three times, from the existing 18 lakh metric tons (MT) to 52 lakh MT) per annum by 2020 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 30%.
<br>
An Assocham-cKinetics study pointed out that global volume of e-waste generated is expected to reach from 93.5 MT in 2016 to 130 MT in 2018 at a CAGR of 17.6 percent during the period.</p>
                    <h3> Waste collection target </h3>
                    <p> A mere 1.5% of India's total e-waste gets recycled due to poor infrastructure, legislation and framework which leads to a waste of diminishing natural resources, irreparable damage of environment and health of the people working in industry. Over 95% of e-waste generated is managed by the unorganised sector and scrap dealers in this market, dismantle the disposed products instead of recycling it.
<br>
In India, about 4-5 lakh child labourers in the age group of 10-15 years are observed to be engaged in various e-waste activities, without adequate protection and safeguards in various yards and recycling workshops, said D S Rawat, Secretary-General Assocham. The chamber advocated the need for effective legislation to prevent entry of child labourers into the e-waste collection, segregation and distribution. </p>
                    <h3> Phased manner </h3>
                    <p> “It is suggested that electronic waste collection targets are implemented in a phased manner with lower and practically achievable target limits. Also, detailed implementation procedures for collection of electronic waste from the market need to be followed,” the study said. </p>
